# Welcome to the XenAPI wiki!

## What is XenAPI?
XenAPI is a REST API allows usage of several of XenForo functions, such as authentication, user information and many more!

XenAPI was created in 2012 by [Contex](https://github.com/Contex) and it was "abandoned" in 2014. Now I am taking the open-source project to maintain it and add a Java API.
