**NOTE:** You must have **XenAPI.jar** as dependency.

For these examples Iâ€™m using these the following values:

| Username | Cadox8 |
| --- | --- |
| User Hash | JDJhJDEwJEd4U2xRQUNNTVJnTzFOM282anZYd08wRk1DTC52NFJtYWtDVHZaNHo1SUZvR0hzUVpLTkU2 |
| API Key | e65ef8da-ca6a-437c-ab8b-4b2e9e86cd10 |

## Getting the API
First, you must have the new API Key setted in api.php and the file in Xenforo root.

In a new program, you have to instance the XenAPI class like this:
```java
XenAPI api = new XenAPI("YOUR_API_KEY"); //I recomend to have a [Version 4 UUID](http://uuidgenerator.net) as the Key
api.setBaseURL("YOUR_FORUM_URL"); //Must have http:// | https://
```

With this, you will be able to send Requests and get the Reply ðŸ’ƒ.

## Creating a Request
You will need to check the Actions and the Params first.

Example of Authentificate request
```java
Request request = RequestBuilder.newBuilder(RequestType.AUTHENTICATE)
.addParam(RequestParam.AUTH_USER, "cadox8")
.addParam(RequestParam.AUTH_PASS, "password").createRequest();
```

The reply for this action will be a JSON text like:
```json
{"hash":"JDJhJDEwJEd4U2xRQUNNTVJnTzFOM282anZYd08wRk1DTC52NFJtYWtDVHZaNHo1SUZvR0hzUVpLTkU2"}
```

## Getting the Reply

But XenAPI has some classes to get the Reply. In this case, you will need to use ``AuthenticateReply``.
This is a example of how to get the reply (for > Java 1.8) and how to handle if we have an error code:

```java
        api.getReply(r, (Callback<AuthenticateReply>) (failCause, result)-> {
            try {
                result.checkError();
                
                if (failCause != null) {
                    failCause.printStackTrace();
                } else {
                    System.out.println("Result: " + result.getHash());
                }
            } catch (ArgsErrorException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        });
```

As you can see, we have ``Callback<AuthenticateReply>`` which allows you to use the methods of these class. You will need to change the class between the ``< >`` when you change your RequestType.
